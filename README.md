# Netflix Hidden Categories WebPage Generator 

Netflix has a master list of categories that go far beyond the usual Action, Drama, Sci-Fi and the like. 
First discovered by the blog What's On Netflix, anyone can access them by simply typing specific URLs into a browser. Each URL has the format:

http://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/###

...where the "###" is where you put the code that relates to the particular category you're looking for. For example, 35800 is steamy romantic movies, 11140 is supernatural thrillers and 67879 is Korean TV shows.


**How it works**

The project main file is generator.php that reads from the csv file the list of Netflix categories (Name;#) and generates the Home.html

You are free to use it and recycle it as you want.
